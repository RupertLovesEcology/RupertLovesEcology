- 👋 Hi, I’m @RupertLovesEcology. I'm a freshwater ecologist with a special interest in creating decision support tools for conservation managers using existing datasets. 
- 👀 From a biotic persepctive, I’m interested in amphibians, freshwater fishes and environmental water. Analytically, I'm interested in population and community models, and decision support tools.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning genetic algorithms for optimisation of agent-based, metapopulation models. Also learning dynamic multi-species occupancy models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really. Reach out, lets talk : )
